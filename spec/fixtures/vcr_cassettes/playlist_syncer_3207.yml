        it matters all that much.\r\n\r\nI like Bukowski well enough but I''m not

        :\r\n\r\nFinally, a new, true Doering, whose other name Dirty is something
        of a fake-out: \u201cI Would\u201d captivates the listener with clean, maximum
        minimal beauty, in typical Doering style. The melodies swing gentle as a cradle,
        the beats take effect in a supporting role and the vocals, though sparsely
        deployed, complete the demand for inner harmony. The elements combine to create
        a languorous, warm feeling around the heart \u2013 a flawless hit.\r\n\r\nAnd
        what\u2019s Marcus Meinhardt up to? He lays a hint of boom behind the track,
        plays with the curiosity created by delay, and garnishes the whole thing with
        a few more sound delights.\r\n\r\nAcid Pauli, well, he does what Acid Pauli
        must do: lengthening the track to almost ten minutes, he builds a myriad of
        levels for psychoactive play, slowly pushing the track to its apex and slowly
        bringing it back, so that it can almost go without the guiding vocals.\r\n\r\nWith
        the digital Bonus Remix by Matthew Styles, the tempo gets yet another push.
        He loses the vocals altogether, mixes in a pinch of ambient and deftly puts
        the focus on the hypnotic undertow of the track, holding it for a full 19
        minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease/catalogue number: bar25-15 Release date: Sep 6,

        byproduct of the group''s affinity for nature, and their notion that the saying

        together.\n\nThese are the first four tracks that the two produced together.\n\nSince

        hockey arenas, an artist who built a thread-radiating mural, the video director
        who conducted fireworks, the pianist who guided the recording of the album,
        and other musical and visual collaborators. The film follows Feist and her
        supporting cast through an impressionistic array of flickering scenery, echoing
        stadiums, puppet workshops, the red carpet, a crumbling French mansion, definitive
        concert performances and uncommonly candid interviews. Itself a part of the
        creative mosaic it portrays, Look At What The Light Did Now illuminates the
        synergy of collaboration, art as magnifying glass, and the power of trust.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"live","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/7584812","user":{"id":1897769,"kind":"user","permalink":"feist-1","username":"Feist","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/1897769","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/feist-1","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000005347957-2rmusg-large.jpg?0c5f27c"},"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/feist-1/look-at-what-the-light-did-now","artwork_url":null,"waveform_url":"http://w1.sndcdn.com/lyHl2FArQ5cy_m.png","stream_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/7584812/stream","playback_count":51671,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":326,"comment_count":22,"attachments_uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/7584812/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":21742179,"created_at":"2011/08/23

        Donzelli (IT) and Ian Hooper (US). The two artists joined forces in the fall

        byproduct of the group''s affinity for nature, and their notion that the saying
        \"mighty oaks from little acorns grow\" is a reflection of their development
        together.\n\nThese are the first four tracks that the two produced together.\n\nSince
        then, bassist Craig Saunders (UK) joined the band to make it a unique international

        G(eek) - Regulate (The Hackulate Synopsis)","description":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulate_(song)#Synopsis\r\n\r\nOn
        a cool, clear night, typical to Southern California, Warren G travels through
        his neighborhood, searching for women with whom he might initiate sexual intercourse.
        He has chosen to engage in this pursuit alone.\r\n\r\nNate Dogg, having just
        arrived in Long Beach, seeks Warren. On his way to find Warren, Nate passes
        a car full of women who are excited to see him. Regardless, he insists to
        the women that there is no cause for excitement.\r\n\r\nWarren makes a left
        turn at 21st Street and Lewis Ave, in the East Hill/Salt Lake neighborhood,
        where he sees a group of young men enjoying a game of dice together. He parks
        his car and greets them. He is excited to find people to play with, but to
        his chagrin, he discovers they intend to relieve him of his material possessions.
        Once the hopeful robbers reveal their firearms, Warren realizes he is in a
        less than favorable predicament.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nate passes the women,
        as they are low on his list of priorities. His primary concern is locating
        Warren. After curtly casting away the strumpets (whose interest in Nate was
        such that they crashed their automobile), he serendipitously stumbles upon
        his friend, Warren G, being held up by the young miscreants.\r\n\r\nWarren,
        unaware that Nate is surreptitiously observing the scene unfold, is in disbelief
        that he is being robbed. The perpetrators have taken jewelry and a name brand
        designer watch from Warren, who is so incredulous that he asks what else the
        robbers intend to steal. This is most likely a rhetorical question.\r\nObserving
        these unfortunate proceedings, Nate realizes that he may have to use his firearm
        to deliver his friend from harm.\r\n\r\nThe tension crescendos as the robbers
        point their guns to Warren''s head. Warren senses the gravity of his situation.
        He cannot believe the events unfolding could happen in his own neighborhood.
        As he imagines himself in a fantastical escape, he catches a glimpse of his
        friend, Nate.\r\nNate has seventeen cartridges to expend (sixteen residing
        in the pistol''s magazine, with a solitary round placed in the chamber and
        ready to be fired) on the group of robbers, and he uses many of them. Afterward,
        he generously shares the credit for neutralizing the situation with Warren,
        though it is clear that Nate did all of the difficult work. Putting congratulations
        aside, Nate quickly reminds himself that he has committed multiple homicides
        to save Warren before letting his friend know that there are females nearby
        if he wishes to fornicate with them.\r\n\r\nWarren recalls that it was the
        promise of copulation that coaxed him away from his previous activities, and
        is thankful that Nate knows a way to satisfy these urges.\r\n\r\nNate quickly
        finds the women who earlier crashed their car on Nate''s account. He remarks
        to one that he is fond of her physical appeal. The woman, impressed by Nate''s
        singing ability, asks that he and Warren allow her and her friends to share
        transportation. Soon, both friends are driving with automobiles full of women
        to the East Side Motel, presumably to consummate their flirtation in an orgy.\r\n\r\nThe
        third verse is more expository, with Warren and Nate explaining their G Funk
        musical style. Warren displays his bravado by claiming that individuals with
        equivalent knowledge could not even attempt to approach his level of lyrical
        mastery. There follows a brief discussion of the genre''s musicological features,
        with special care taken to point out that in said milieu the rhythm is not
        in fact the rhythm, as one might assume, but actually the bass. Similarly
        the bass serves a purpose closer to that which the treble would in more traditional
        musical forms. Nate goes on to note that if any third party smokes as he does,
        they would find themselves in a state of intoxication daily (from Nate''s
        other works, it can be inferred that the substance referenced is marijuana).
        Nate concludes his delineation of the night by issuing a vague threat to \"busters,\"
        suggesting that he and Warren will further \"regulate\" any potential incidents
        in the future (presumably by engaging their enemies with small arms fire).","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"original","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjG0u_J-VE","bpm":114.0,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"aiff","license":"cc-by","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/4626023","user":{"id":8,"kind":"user","permalink":"alex","username":"Alex","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/8","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/alex","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000008228265-9j2fdh-large.jpg?0c5f27c"},"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/alex/warren-g-eek-hackulate-the-synopsis-edition","artwork_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000002102202-9ah1c2-large.jpg?0c5f27c","waveform_url":"http://w1.sndcdn.com/r8q9nm97edwD_m.png","stream_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/4626023/stream","download_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/4626023/download","playback_count":6074,"download_count":184,"favoritings_count":46,"comment_count":39,"attachments_uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/4626023/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":3638766,"created_at":"2010/06/25

        \u0026 Sons - Little Lion Man","description":"Mumford \u0026 Sons release
        their debut album, \u2018Sigh No More\u2019 through Gentlemen Of The Road
        / Island Records on the 5th October 2009. It will be preceded by a new single,
        \u2018Little Lion Man\u2019, on the 28th September.\r\n\r\nFresh from a series
        of acclaimed festival appearances throughout the summer, Mumford \u0026 Sons
        deliver their eagerly anticipated debut album as one of Britain\u2019s most
        beguiling young acts in years.\r\n\r\nCreating a gutsy, old-time sound that
        marries the magic of Crosby, Stills \u0026 Nash with the might of Kings of
        Leon, the incredible energy of Mumford \u0026 Sons draws us quickly into their
        circle of songs: to the warmth of their stories and to this magical community
        of misty-eyed men. \r\n\r\nSince the band formed in late 2007, their primary
        goal has been to make music that matters. Mumford \u0026 Sons are Marcus Mumford
        (vocals, guitar, bass drum, and tambourine strapped to his left foot and right),
        Ben Lovett (keyboards), Country Winston (banjo, dobro, electric guitar) and
        Ted Dwane (bass). By the beginning of this year, the band had already been
        shortlisted for the BBC Sounds Of 2009 Poll.\r\n\r\nMaking the road their
        rolling home is what has made Mumford \u0026 Sons who they are today. Word
        spread quickly, from navigating The Thames on a boat from Camden to Oxford,
        to selling out London\u2019s ICA, by way of SXSW and an American tour, the
        following was building fast. The live show has since turned into a real spectacle,
        and a euphoric event.\r\n\r\nWith three limited edition, self-produced EPs
        under their belt, the band will precede the release of \u2018Sigh No More\u2019
        with the single, \u2018Little Lion Man\u2019 \u2013 already acknowledged by
        Zane Lowe\u2019s Radio 1 show as \u2018The Hottest Record In The World Today\u2019.
        \r\n\r\nThis extraordinary debut was produced by Markus Dravs (Arcade Fire,
        Bjork, The Maccabees), who actively encouraged the band to be more instinctive,
        to be more themselves, and strengthen their already-powerful musical personality.
        \r\n\r\nThe album begins with the powerful title track, Sigh No More, a statement
        of intent that references the romantic language of Shakespeare''s Much Ado
        About Nothing, as the four men sing together in glorious unison: \"Love it
        will not betray you, dismay or enslave you / It will set you free / Be more
        like the man you were made to be.\" Amongst darkly reflective tracks such
        as Thistle \u0026 Weeds and ballads like White Blank Page, Winter Winds and
        Roll Away Your Stone, by contrast, show the band''s sprightlier side, the
        rollicking banjo of the former conjuring up stormy weather that \"litters
        London with lonely hearts\"; the latter a fabulous hoedown about a man unsuccessfully
        filling the hole in his soul.\r\n\r\nAs the album moves on, this fervour never
        dies. After a wild lashing out in the murderous fable of Dust Bowl Dance,
        After The Storm arrives, the only track Mumford and Sons wrote in the studio,
        away from the live stage they knew so well. It stands an incredibly moving
        final track to an incredibly moving album \u2013 the story of a man scared
        of what''s behind and what''s before, and creates a considered conclusion
        to the band\u2019s epic debut album.\r\n\r\nMumford \u0026 Sons\u2019 live
        reputation goes before them, and now their incredible debut reveals the extent
        of their magic and majesty on record. Feel the fire in your belly and the
        romance in your heart as you listen, let your voice break into rapture \u2013
        and you too sigh no more.\r\n","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"aac","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/609722","user":{"id":37223,"kind":"user","permalink":"stayloose","username":"Stayloose","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/37223","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/stayloose","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000000662754-qadsdv-large.jpg?0c5f27c"},"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/stayloose/mumford-sons-little-lion-man","artwork_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000000569075-x0tyvr-large.jpg?0c5f27c","waveform_url":"http://w1.sndcdn.com/VqggABctq3LE_m.png","stream_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/609722/stream","playback_count":180016,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1448,"comment_count":55,"attachments_uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/609722/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":911236,"created_at":"2009/11/14

        - Spanish Sahara","description":"In April of 2008, we at Sub Pop Records had
        the good fortune to release the US version of Antidotes, the debut album by
        Oxford, UK quintet Foals. Antidotes was a special album. Two years on from
        that impressive introduction, a choice has been made\u2013-rather than contort
        Antidotes\u2019 lithesome guitars into ever more elaborate patterns, Total
        Life Forever is the sound of a band settling into and surveying the decay
        of old protocols. With this new album, Foals strip their sound back and turn
        themselves inside out searching for that invisible human thing. The result
        is an album as persuasive emotionally as Antidotes was physically. Whereas
        that album constantly reinforced its own presence by filling the air with
        yelping and polyrhythm, tracks on Total Life Forever such as disarming opener
        \u201cBlue Blood,\u201d \u201c2 Trees\u201d and the astonishing \u201cBlack
        Gold\u201d are happier to leave gaps for the listener to explore in mind\u2019s
        ear and eye. Written primarily in the basement of their Oxford HQ (\u201cThe
        House of Supreme Mathematics\u201d) and recorded in Gothenburg with former
        Clor man Luke Smith, Total Life Forever finds Foals singing rather than shouting,
        emotional as well as functional. The band\u2019s soul-search reveals new antidotes
        found in infinite, internal spaces rather than carved violently upon the air\u2013-Total
        Life Forever feels more the work of artists than artisans. It\u2019s a triumph
        that they\u2019ve managed to remain a band of progress and propulsion while
        investigating that vast, dark space lurking inside themselves-\u2013that gap
        between ribs where \u201cnature, or god or whatever you wanna call it, will
        come in.\u201d\r\n\r\nReleased: June 15, 2010\r\n\r\n1. Blue Blood\r\n2. Miami\r\n3.
